 * The LinkedHashMap is just like HashMap with an additional feature of maintaining an order of elements inserted into it.
 * HashMap provided the advantage of quick insertion, search, and deletion but it never maintained the track and order of
 * insertion which the LinkedHashMap provides where the elements can be accessed in their insertion order.
