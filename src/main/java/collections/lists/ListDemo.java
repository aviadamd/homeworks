/**
 * List Interface:
 * This is a child interface of the collection interface.
 * This interface is dedicated to the data of the list type in which we can store all the ordered collection of the objects.
 * This also allows duplicate data to be present in it.
 * This list interface is implemented by various classes like
 * ArrayList, Vector, Stack, etc. Since all the subclasses implement the list,
 * we can instantiate a list object with any of these classes.
